            When you visit a YouTube page on Firefox or in Chrome, the{" "}
            <span> youtube ads blocker firefox </span>scans the webpage and
            identifies the elements associated with ads. It then prevents them
            from loading or displaying on the page. This effectively removes or
            hides the ads from your view, and lets you enjoy the video content
            without interruptions.
